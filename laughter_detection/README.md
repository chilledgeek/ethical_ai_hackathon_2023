# Installation and Running Instructions

## Setting up the Conda Environment

1. **Install Conda**: If you haven't already, install Conda. You can download it from [Anaconda's official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

2. **Create the Conda Environment**: Navigate to the directory containing the `environment.yml` file. Then, run the following command to create a Conda environment using Python 3.7:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml python=3.7
   ```

3. **Activate the Conda Environment**: Once the environment is created, activate it using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda activate laughter
   ```

## Running the Streamlit App

After activating the `laughter` environment, you can run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server, and you should be able to access the app in your browser.
